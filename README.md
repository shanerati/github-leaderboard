# GitHub Leaderboard

A simple app that displays the top starred repositories and commits from the last day.

### Getting Started

The app pulls a fair amount of data from GitHub's API, so you can authenticate from the command line for increased rate limits.

To run, use `REACT_APP_GITHUB_USER=<github username> REACT_APP_GITHUB_PASS=<github personal access token> yarn start`
